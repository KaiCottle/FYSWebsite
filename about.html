                    <p>About Mary!</p>
                    <p>Mary Shelley is a very well renown author. Born on August 30th, 1797, to parents William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Mary's life was quickly met with adversity, as her mother, unfortunately, passed only 11 days after her birth. Mary's education was never subpar. Shelley studied subjects such as history, religion, literature, and earth sciences. In 1814, Mary began her relationship with her eventual husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley. The couple had three children, who all passed at young ages. Shelley's most popular novel, Frankenstein was inspired during her trip to Lake Geneva in 1816, then published two years after. During her lifetime, Mary Shelley wrote 8 books by herself and one she co-authored with her husband. Mary Shelley passed away on February 1st, 1851 at the age of 53.     </p>
